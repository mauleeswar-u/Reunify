# Reunify 

## Problem Statement  
Losing personal belongings in public places like airports, parks, restaurants, and malls is a common issue. Existing lost-and-found services are often inefficient, lack transparency, and provide limited tracking capabilities. There is a need for a centralized, user-friendly platform to streamline the process of reporting, tracking, and recovering lost items.  

## Solution  
The **Reunify** is a web-based solution designed to connect individuals who have lost or found items. It offers users the ability to report lost or found items with detailed descriptions, photos, and location information. The platform includes features such as location-based search, notifications, and an admin dashboard for verification and management. Future enhancements could include AI-powered image recognition to improve item-matching accuracy.  

## Features  
- **User Registration and Authentication**: Secure user accounts for managing reports.  
- **Report Lost/Found Items**: Users can submit detailed reports with images, descriptions, and locations.  
- **Location-Based Search**: Interactive maps display nearby lost and found items.  
- **Notification System**: Users receive alerts when a matching item is reported.  
- **Verification System**: Ensures accurate matching and minimizes fraudulent claims.  
- **Admin Dashboard**: Enables administrators to oversee reports, verify claims, and resolve disputes.  
- **AI Integration (Future Scope)**: Facilitates image recognition for automated item matching.
